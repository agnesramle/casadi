#! CasADi tutorial
#! ==================
#! This tutorial file explains the interface with IPOPT
#! Ipopt solves problems of the form:
#!
#!
#! Minimize     f(x)
#! x in R^n
#! s.t         g_L <= g(x) <= g_U
#! x_L <= x    <= x_U
from numpy import *
import numpy as n
from casadi import *

#! Quadractic program
#! ------------------
#! Using Ipopt to do a simple quadratic problem
#!
#! 
P = n.eye(5)
A = n.diag([2.0,1,4,10,-2])
q = [1,0,0,0,0]
b = [1,1,1,1,1]

X = MX.sym("x",5,1)
P = MX(DM(P))
q = MX(DM(q))
A = MX(DM(A))

#! Objective
F = 0.5*mtimes([X.T,P,X]) + mtimes(q.T,X)

#! Constraint
G = X+X

#! NLP
nlp = {'x':X, 'f':F, 'g':G}

solver = nlpsol("nlp","ipopt", nlp)
solver.printOptions()

#! The default lower an upper bound on the optimizations variables is zero.
#! Change them to unbouded as follows:
lbx = [-100,-100,-100,-100,-100]
ubx = [ 100, 100, 100, 100, 100]

#! Inequality constraints.
#! The lower bound is also necessary, although Ipopt itself does not seem to require it
ubg = b
lbg = [-100,-100,-100,-100,-100]

sol = solver(lbx=lbx, ubx=ubx, lbg=lbg, ubg=ubg)
print(sol["x"])
#! Nested optimization
